State management library for ES5+ environments designed for ease of use.

## Recommended IDE

You should be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) because its simple, fast, extensible and beloved by many developers.

Make sure to install all the [recommended extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_recommended-extensions) that come with the repository for the best possible coding experience.

## NPM Scripts

Note that these examples use yarn but you can use the equivalent `npm run <command>` instead.

Most of them will automatically run when you perform certain actions on your repository.

### Code style

Ensures code consistency in your code base.

These commands automatically get run before commits.

- `yarn style` - Runs all style:\* commands.
- `yarn style:lint` - Lints your code using [eslint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint).
- `yarn style:format` - Formats your code using [prettier](https://prettier.io/).

### Build Tasks

Creates builds from your Typescript files for [CommonJS (cjs)](https://flaviocopes.com/commonjs/) and [ES6 modules (esm)](https://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_core-features.html#sec_from-cjs-to-esm).

- `yarn build` - Runs all build commands which creates builds for different node environments.
- `yarn build:main` - Creates a build using cjs modules.
- `yarn build:module` - Creates a build using esm modules.

### Testing

Ensures code is reliable by running your [jest](https://jestjs.io/en/) unit tests.

Unit tests automatically get run before commits.

- `yarn test` - Runs all tests and generates a code coverage report.
- `yarn test:watch` - Watches file changes and reruns tests for those changed files.

### Code Coverage

Generates and publishes documentation based on your [typedoc](https://typedoc.org/) comments.

- `yarn cov` - Generate a code coverage report.
- `yarn cov:open` - Open generated code coverage report.
- `yarn cov:publish` - Publish generated code coverage reports to [codecov](https://codecov.io/).
  Running this command locally will require the upload token for e.g `yarn cov:publish --token="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"`

### Documentation

Generate and publishing documentation based on your [typedoc](https://typedoc.org/) comments.

- `yarn doc` - Generates documentation from code.
- `yarn doc:open` - Opens generated documentation in your default browser.
- `yarn doc:publish` - Publishes generated documentation.

### Helpers

These commands perform misc tasks.

- `yarn commit` - Create a new commit using the [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) cli.
- `yarn clean` - Cleans up all build artifacts such as the distribution folder.

## Conventional Commits

Commit messages to this repository that don't follow the [conventional commit guidelines](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/) will be rejected by a `commit-msg` [git hook](#Git-Hooks).

No one likes rejection so use the `yarn commit` script which provides a CLI interface for creating formated commits.

## Git Hooks

If you would like to run custom tasks during important actions on a repository you can use [git hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks).

To make this as simple as possible we use [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) which is also used in the [conventional commits toolchain](#Conventional-Commits).

## Debugging

The following [launch configurations](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) will assist with debugging your library.

- `Current TS File` - debug current typescript file.
- `Current Jest Test` - debug current jest test.
- `All Jest Tests` - debug all jest tests.
